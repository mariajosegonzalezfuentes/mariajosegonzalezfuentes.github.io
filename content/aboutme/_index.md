# About Me

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at [ENS de Lyon](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/en/) and the Center for Economic Research on Governance, Inequality and Conflict [CERGIC](https://www.cergic-lyon.fr/), under the supervision of [Sophie Hatte](https://sites.google.com/site/sophiehatte/).

My research interests are in Gender Economics, with a focus on the intersection of **gender** and **politics**. I am also interested in experimental methods.  

Prior to my PhD I was a pre-doc at INSEAD and a Research Assistant at the Women in Business Chair from Sciences Po (LIEPP). 

I hold a Master's degree in Analysis and Policy in Economics from the Paris School of Economics (PSE).
