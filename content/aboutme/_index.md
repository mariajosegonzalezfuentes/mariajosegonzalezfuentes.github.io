# About Me
I am a PhD candidate in Economics at <a href="https://www.ens-lyon.fr/en/" style="text-decoration: none; color: var(--primary); border-bottom: none;">ENS de Lyon</a> and the Center for Economic Research on Governance, Inequality and Conflict <a href="https://www.cergic-lyon.fr/" style="text-decoration: none; color: var(--primary); border-bottom: none;">CERGIC</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sophiehatte/" style="text-decoration: none; color: var(--primary); border-bottom: none;">Sophie Hatte</a>.

My research interests are in Gender Economics, with a focus on the intersection of **gender** and **politics**. I am also interested in experimental methods.  

Prior to my PhD I was a pre-doc at INSEAD and a Research Assistant at the Women in Business Chair from Sciences Po (LIEPP). 

I hold a Master's degree in Analysis and Policy in Economics from the Paris School of Economics (PSE).
