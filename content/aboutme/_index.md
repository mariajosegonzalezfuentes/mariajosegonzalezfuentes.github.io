# About Me

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at [ENS Lyon](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/en/) and the Center for Economic Research on Governance, Inequality and Conflict [CERGIC](https://www.cergic-lyon.fr/).

My research interests are in Gender Economics, with a focus on the intersection of gender, politics and media. I am also interested in experimental and behavior economics. I am supervised by [Sophie Hatte](https://sites.google.com/site/sophiehatte/). 

Before starting my PhD I was a pre-doc at INSEAD and a Research Assistant at the Women in Business Chair from Sciences Po (LIEPP). 

I hold a Master's degree in Analysis and Policy in Economics from the Paris School of Economics (PSE).
